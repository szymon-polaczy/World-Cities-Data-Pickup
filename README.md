# World-Cities-Data-Pickup

### What This Project Needs (This has to be installed)
* [lxml](https://lxml.de/)

---

### What there is still to be done
- [ ] use simple "==" instead of array.find
- [ ] refactor most of the code and the if-statements
- [ ] there are cities that have only have of their name as a link and because of that the name gets split and we can't find the page for it - searching with next element in array to combat this
- [ ] main functions are to big - they have to split
- [ ] make it as fast as it can be
- [ ] start using try...catch blocks
- [x] better image capturing
- [ ] there are countries like - Białoruś/Japonia - which have different places to store theirs cities names - better city name capturing
- [ ] there's a bug with "Położenie" in Tokio - it doesn't get the "Brak danych" mark
